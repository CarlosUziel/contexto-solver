## üß† Motivation

[Contexto](https://contexto.me) is a word puzzle game where players try to find a secret word. After each guess, the game tells you the position of your guessed word in a list sorted by similarity to the secret word. The closer your guess is to the secret word, the lower the number.

This repository provides a Python-based solution to simulate and automatically solve the Contexto game. It works by instantiating a simulated version of the game and then employing a solver. The solver leverages the Qdrant vector database's discovery API to find the secret word by iteratively guessing words and narrowing down the search space based on the similarity scores provided by the game.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Docker**: To run the Qdrant vector database. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   **uv**: A fast Python package installer and resolver. [Installation Guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CarlosUziel/contexto-solver.git
    cd contexto-solver
    ```

2.  Install project dependencies using uv:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Usage

1.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    Copy the distributed environment file `.env.dist` to `.env` and modify it with your Qdrant settings if necessary (default values should work for a local setup).
    ```bash
    cp .env.dist .env
    ```

2.  **Start Qdrant Docker Instance**:
    Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` to start the Qdrant service.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Populate the Database**:
    Run the setup script to populate the Qdrant database with the word embeddings. Make sure your `PYTHONPATH` includes the `src` directory.
    ```bash
    export PYTHONPATH=./src:$PYTHONPATH
    python src/db/setup_qdrant.py
    ```

4.  **Start the Streamlit App**:
    Launch the Streamlit application.
    ```bash
    streamlit run src/app/contexto_app.py
    ```

The Streamlit application provides the following options:
*   **Normal Game**: Play a simulated Contexto game yourself.
*   **Autosolve**: Watch the solver automatically find the secret word.
*   **Benchmarks**: Run performance tests on the solver.

## üí° Algorithm Explanation

The Contexto solver employs a multi-stage strategy to pinpoint the secret word. This process heavily relies on Qdrant's vector search capabilities, especially its [*Discovery API*](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/explore/#discovery-api), to navigate the word-embedding space efficiently. Let $V$ represent the vector embedding of a word.

Here's a breakdown of the solver's process:

1.  **Initial Guess: $G_0$**
    *   If no guesses have been made (i.e., the set of past guesses $\mathcal{G}_{past}$ is empty), the solver selects a word $w_0$ uniformly at random from the entire collection. Its embedding is $V_0$. This serves as the initial anchor point.

2.  **Iterative Refinement via Discovery Search (for guess $G_i, i \ge 1$)**
    *   Once at least one guess $(w_{prev}, r_{prev}, V_{prev})$ exists, the solver primarily uses Qdrant's Discovery API. This requires constructing:
        *   **Context Pairs ($\mathcal{C}$)**: A list of positive and negative example embeddings to guide the search.
        *   **Target Vector ($V_{target}$)**: An optional specific point in the embedding space to steer the search towards.
        *   **Set of Past Guesses ($\mathcal{G}_{past}$)**: To exclude already tried words.

    *   **Context Pair Formation**:
        *   **For the first guess ($G_0$ with embedding $V_0$)**: A single context pair is formed. The positive example is $V_0$, and the negative example is $-V_0$ (the negation of the first guess's embedding). This initial pair helps establish a basic direction.
        *   **For subsequent guesses ($G_i$ with embedding $V_i$, where $i \ge 1$)**: Let $(w_{best}, r_{best}, V_{best})$ be the current best guess (lowest rank) from $\mathcal{G}_{past}$.
            *   If $w_i$ is better than $w_{best}$ (i.e., $r_i < r_{best}$), the new context pair is (positive: $V_i$, negative: $V_{best}$). $w_i$ becomes the new $w_{best}$.
            *   If $w_i$ is not better than $w_{best}$ (i.e., $r_i \ge r_{best}$), the new context pair is (positive: $V_{best}$, negative: $V_i$).
        *   Each new guess $G_i$ results in one additional context pair being added to $\mathcal{C}$.

    *   **Target Vector ($V_{target}$) Determination**:
        *   The solver maintains a list of embeddings, $\mathcal{V}_{positive\_centroid}$, which includes the embedding of the first guess and any subsequent guess that became the new best guess.
            *   **For the second guess ($G_1$, when $|\mathcal{G}_{past}|=1$)**: The `target` vector is `None`. The Discovery API search relies solely on the initial context pair. The `limit` for search results is higher (e.g., 8) to encourage broader exploration.
            *   **For guesses $G_i$ where $i \ge 2$ (when $|\mathcal{G}_{past}| > 1$)**: The `target` vector $V_{target}$ is the centroid (mean) of all embeddings in $\mathcal{V}_{positive\_centroid}$. The `limit` for search results is typically 1.

    *   **Executing Discovery Search**:
        *   The solver calls Qdrant's `discover` method with the accumulated $\mathcal{C}$, the determined $V_{target}$ (if any), a filter to exclude words in $\mathcal{G}_{past}$, and other search parameters like `hnsw_ef`.

> **Qdrant Discovery API Behavior Notes:**
> The Discovery API is a powerful feature for exploring the vector space. It allows searching for points (word embeddings in this case) that are "semantically similar" to a set of positive example vectors and "dissimilar" to a set of negative example vectors. This similarity/dissimilarity is typically determined by vector distances (e.g., cosine similarity or dot product) in the embedding space.
>   -   When a `target` vector is provided, the search is not only guided by the positive/negative context pairs but is also biased towards this specific `target` point. This dual influence helps to steer the exploration towards a region of interest that the solver has identified as promising (e.g., the centroid of previously successful guesses), effectively refining the search within a known good area. The API attempts to find points that are close to the positive examples, far from the negative examples, and also close to the target vector.
>   -   If no `target` is provided (i.e., `target` is `None`), the API focuses solely on optimizing the search based on the given positive and negative context pairs. It seeks items that best satisfy these relative relationships‚Äîclose to positives, far from negatives‚Äîwithout a specific directional anchor. This mode is particularly useful in the early stages of the solving process, such as for the second guess, to encourage broader exploration and discover new potential areas of the embedding space.
>   -   The effectiveness of the Discovery API can be influenced by the quality and quantity of the context pairs provided. More pairs can offer finer-grained control over the search direction, helping Qdrant better understand the desired semantic region.

### Failure Condition

*   If the initial random guess cannot be fetched (e.g., collection issue), a `SolverUnableToGuessError` is raised.
*   If the Qdrant Discovery Search, after processing its results, does not yield any new candidate word (i.e., all candidates returned by Qdrant are already in $\mathcal{G}_{past}$ or no candidates are returned), the solver raises a `SolverUnableToGuessError`.
*   If the Discovery Search itself encounters an operational error (e.g., an issue with the Qdrant service), a `SolverUnableToGuessError` is raised, wrapping the original exception.

This iterative cycle of guessing, receiving rank feedback, updating context ($\mathcal{C}, V_{target}, \mathcal{V}_{positive\_centroid}$), and strategically querying the vector database allows the solver to progressively narrow the search space towards the secret word.
