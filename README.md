## üß† Motivation

[Contexto](https://contexto.me) is a word puzzle game where the primary objective is to discover a secret word. Players make guesses, and after each attempt, the game reveals the guessed word's rank. This rank indicates its position in a list sorted by similarity to the secret word‚Äîthe lower the number, the closer the guess. The ultimate goal is to identify the secret word using the fewest number of attempts.

The game's ranking system is powered by word embeddings, specifically GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words, meaning that words with similar meanings are located closer to each other in a high-dimensional vector space. The rank provided by Contexto reflects this semantic proximity: a guess semantically closer to the target word will receive a lower rank.

This repository offers a Python-based solution that simulates the Contexto game and includes an automated solver. The user interface is a Streamlit web application, allowing users to play the game manually, observe the solver in action, or run benchmarks. This application connects to a Python backend that manages the game logic and implements the solving algorithm. At the core of this system is [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/), a vector database used to store, process, and efficiently query the GloVe word embeddings. Qdrant's capabilities, particularly its discovery API, are fundamental to the solver's strategy for navigating the embedding space and pinpointing the secret word.

## üí° Algorithm Explanation

The Contexto solver employs a multi-stage strategy to pinpoint the secret word. This process heavily relies on Qdrant's vector search capabilities, especially its [*Discovery API*](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/explore/#discovery-api), to navigate the word-embedding space efficiently. Let $V$ represent the vector embedding of a word.

Here's a breakdown of the solver's process:

1.  **Initial Guess: $G_0$**
    *   If no guesses have been made (i.e., the set of past guesses $\mathcal{G}_{past}$ is empty), the solver selects a word $w_0$ uniformly at random from the entire collection. Its embedding is $V_0$. This serves as the initial anchor point.

2.  **Iterative Refinement via Discovery Search (for guess $G_i, i \ge 1$)**
    *   Once at least one guess $(w_{prev}, r_{prev}, V_{prev})$ exists, the solver primarily uses Qdrant's Discovery API. This requires constructing:
        *   **Context Pairs ($\mathcal{C}$)**: A list of positive and negative example embeddings to guide the search.
        *   **Target Vector ($V_{target}$)**: An optional specific point in the embedding space to steer the search towards.
        *   **Set of Past Guesses ($\mathcal{G}_{past}$)**: To exclude already tried words.

    *   **Context Pair Formation**:
        *   **For the first guess ($G_0$ with embedding $V_0$)**: A single context pair is formed. The positive example is $V_0$, and the negative example is $-V_0$ (the negation of the first guess's embedding). This initial pair helps establish a basic direction.
        *   **For subsequent guesses ($G_i$ with embedding $V_i$, where $i \ge 1$)**: Let $(w_{best}, r_{best}, V_{best})$ be the current best guess (lowest rank) from $\mathcal{G}_{past}$.
            *   If $w_i$ is better than $w_{best}$ (i.e., $r_i < r_{best}$), the new context pair is (positive: $V_i$, negative: $V_{best}$). $w_i$ becomes the new $w_{best}$.
            *   If $w_i$ is not better than $w_{best}$ (i.e., $r_i \ge r_{best}$), the new context pair is (positive: $V_{best}$, negative: $V_i$).
        *   Each new guess $G_i$ results in one additional context pair being added to $\mathcal{C}$.

    *   **Target Vector ($V_{target}$) Determination**:
        *   The solver maintains a list of embeddings, $\mathcal{V}_{positive\_centroid}$, which includes the embedding of the first guess and any subsequent guess that became the new best guess.
            *   **For the second guess ($G_1$, when $|\mathcal{G}_{past}|=1$)**: The `target` vector is `None`. The Discovery API search relies solely on the initial context pair.
            *   **For guesses $G_i$ where $i \ge 2$ (when $|\mathcal{G}_{past}| > 1$)**: The `target` vector $V_{target}$ is the centroid (mean) of all embeddings in $\mathcal{V}_{positive\_centroid}$.
            *   In all discovery searches (i.e., for any guess $G_i$ where $i \ge 1$), the `limit` for search results is 1. This focuses the search on the single best candidate based on the current context and target vector (if present).

    *   **Executing Discovery Search**:
        *   The solver calls Qdrant's `discover` method with the accumulated $\mathcal{C}$, the determined $V_{target}$ (if any), a filter to exclude words in $\mathcal{G}_{past}$, and other search parameters like `hnsw_ef`.

> **Qdrant Discovery API Behavior Notes:**
> 
> The Discovery API is a powerful feature for exploring the vector space. It allows searching for points (word embeddings in this case) that are "semantically similar" to a set of positive example vectors and "dissimilar" to a set of negative example vectors. This similarity/dissimilarity is typically determined by vector distances (e.g., cosine similarity or dot product) in the embedding space.
>   -   When a `target` vector is provided, the search is not only guided by the positive/negative context pairs but is also biased towards this specific `target` point. This dual influence helps to steer the exploration towards a region of interest that the solver has identified as promising (e.g., the centroid of previously successful guesses), effectively refining the search within a known good area. The API attempts to find points that are close to the positive examples, far from the negative examples, and also close to the target vector.
>   -   If no `target` is provided (i.e., `target` is `None`), the API focuses solely on optimizing the search based on the given positive and negative context pairs. It seeks items that best satisfy these relative relationships‚Äîclose to positives, far from negatives‚Äîwithout a specific directional anchor. This mode is particularly useful in the early stages of the solving process, such as for the second guess, to encourage broader exploration and discover new potential areas of the embedding space.
>   -   The effectiveness of the Discovery API can be influenced by the quality and quantity of the context pairs provided. More pairs can offer finer-grained control over the search direction, helping Qdrant better understand the desired semantic region.

### Failure Condition

*   If the initial random guess cannot be fetched (e.g., collection issue), a `SolverUnableToGuessError` is raised.
*   If the Qdrant Discovery Search, after processing its results, does not yield any new candidate word (i.e., all candidates returned by Qdrant are already in $\mathcal{G}_{past}$ or no candidates are returned), the solver raises a `SolverUnableToGuessError`. This indicates a critical failure in the core guessing strategy, as the solver relies on discovery search to make progress.
*   If the Discovery Search itself encounters an operational error (e.g., an issue with the Qdrant service), a `SolverUnableToGuessError` is raised, wrapping the original exception.

This iterative cycle of guessing, receiving rank feedback, updating context ($\mathcal{C}, V_{target}, \mathcal{V}_{positive\_centroid}$), and strategically querying the vector database allows the solver to progressively narrow the search space towards the secret word.
