## üß† Motivation

[Contexto](https://contexto.me) is a word puzzle game where the primary objective is to discover a secret word. Players make guesses, and after each attempt, the game reveals the guessed word's rank. This rank indicates its position in a list sorted by similarity to the secret word‚Äîthe lower the number, the closer the guess. The ultimate goal is to identify the secret word using the fewest number of attempts.

The game's ranking system is powered by word embeddings, specifically GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words, meaning that words with similar meanings are located closer to each other in a high-dimensional vector space. The rank provided by Contexto reflects this semantic proximity: a guess semantically closer to the target word will receive a lower rank.

This repository offers a Python-based solution that simulates the Contexto game and includes an automated solver. The user interface is a Streamlit web application, allowing users to play the game manually, observe the solver in action, or run benchmarks. This application connects to a Python backend that manages the game logic and implements the solving algorithm. At the core of this system is [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/), a vector database used to store, process, and efficiently query the GloVe word embeddings. Qdrant's capabilities, particularly its discovery API, are fundamental to the solver's strategy for navigating the embedding space and pinpointing the secret word.

### GloVe Dataset

*   `GLOVE_DATASET`: Specifies the GloVe dataset to use for word embeddings. The choice of dataset affects the vocabulary size and the dimensionality of word vectors, which can influence solver performance and resource usage.
    *   Default: `glove.6B.100d`
    *   Available Options:
        *   `glove.6B.50d`
        *   `glove.6B.100d`

The collection name will be the `GLOVE_DATASET` name suffixed with `_nouns` (e.g., `glove.6B.100d_nouns`). This can be useful for a more targeted search if the secret word is known or suspected to be a noun.

## üí° Algorithm Explanation

The Contexto solver employs a multi-stage strategy to pinpoint the secret word. This process heavily relies on Qdrant's vector search capabilities, especially its [*Discovery API*](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/explore/#discovery-api), to navigate the word-embedding space efficiently. Word frequency, obtained using the `wordfreq` library, plays a crucial role in prioritizing candidate words at various stages. Let $V$ represent the vector embedding of a word.

Here's a breakdown of the solver's process:

1.  **Initial Guess: $G_0$**
    *   If no guesses have been made (i.e., the set of past guesses $\mathcal{G}_{past}$ is empty), the solver fetches a batch of `RANDOM_SAMPLE_SIZE_FOR_FREQ_CHECK` random words from the collection. It then selects the word with the highest frequency in the English language (using the `wordfreq` library) as the initial guess $w_0$. Its embedding is $V_0$. This serves as the initial anchor point.
    *   If this process fails to yield a word (e.g., all sampled words have zero frequency or are invalid), it attempts to fetch a single random point as a fallback.

2.  **Iterative Refinement via Discovery Search (for guess $G_i, i \ge 1$)**
    *   Once at least one guess $(w_{prev}, r_{prev}, V_{prev})$ exists, the solver primarily uses Qdrant's Discovery API. This requires constructing:
        *   **Context Pairs**: For each past guess $(w_j, r_j, V_j)$, a context pair is formed. If $w_j$ improved upon the previous best guess (i.e., $r_j < r_{best\_prev}$), then $V_j$ becomes a positive example and $V_{best\_prev}$ becomes a negative example. Otherwise, $V_{best\_prev}$ remains positive and $V_j$ becomes negative.
        *   **Target Vector (Centroid)**: The solver maintains a list of the top `TOP_N_POSITIVE_EMBEDDINGS` best (lowest rank) positive embeddings encountered so far. A centroid (average vector) is calculated from these embeddings. This centroid serves as the `target` for the discovery search, guiding it towards promising regions of the embedding space.
    *   The Discovery API is then queried with these context pairs and the target centroid. The search is limited to `DISCOVERY_SEARCH_LIMIT` results.
    *   From the returned results, the solver selects the word with the highest frequency in English. This word becomes the next guess $w_i$. This frequency check ensures that more common and relevant words are prioritized among the semantically similar candidates.

3.  **Fallback Strategy**
    *   If the Discovery Search (Step 2) does not return any usable results (e.g., all candidates are already guessed or have zero frequency), the solver falls back to the random word selection strategy described in Step 1 (fetching `RANDOM_SAMPLE_SIZE_FOR_FREQ_CHECK` words and selecting the most frequent one).

> [!NOTE]
> **More about Qdrant Discovery API and Word Frequency:**
>
> The Discovery API is a powerful feature for exploring the vector space. It allows searching for points (word embeddings in this case) that are "semantically similar" to a set of positive example vectors and "dissimilar" to a set of negative example vectors. This similarity/dissimilarity is typically determined by vector distances (e.g., cosine similarity or dot product) in the embedding space.
>   -   When a `target` vector is provided, the search is not only guided by the positive/negative context pairs but is also biased towards this specific `target` point. This dual influence helps to steer the exploration towards a region of interest that the solver has identified as promising (e.g., the centroid of previously successful guesses), effectively refining the search within a known good area. The API attempts to find points that are close to the positive examples, far from the negative examples, and also close to the target vector.
>   -   If no `target` is provided (i.e., `target` is `None`), the API focuses solely on optimizing the search based on the given positive and negative context pairs. It seeks items that best satisfy these relative relationships‚Äîclose to positives, far from negatives‚Äîwithout a specific directional anchor. This mode is particularly useful in the early stages of the solving process, such as for the second guess, to encourage broader exploration and discover new potential areas of the embedding space.
>   -   The effectiveness of the Discovery API can be influenced by the quality and quantity of the context pairs provided. More pairs can offer finer-grained control over the search direction, helping Qdrant better understand the desired semantic region.
>   -   **Word Frequency Prioritization**: After the Discovery API returns a list of candidate words, the solver uses the `wordfreq` library to determine the frequency of each candidate in the English language. The candidate with the highest frequency is chosen as the next guess. This step is crucial because vector similarity alone might suggest obscure or highly specific words. By prioritizing more common words, the solver aims to make guesses that are more likely to be the target word in a general-knowledge game like Contexto. This heuristic significantly improves the solver's practical performance and relevance of suggestions.

### Failure Condition

*   If the initial random guess cannot be fetched (e.g., collection issue), a `SolverUnableToGuessError` is raised.
*   If the Qdrant Discovery Search, after processing its results, does not yield any new candidate word (i.e., all candidates returned by Qdrant are already in $\mathcal{G}_{past}$ or no candidates are returned), the solver raises a `SolverUnableToGuessError`. This indicates a critical failure in the core guessing strategy, as the solver relies on discovery search to make progress.
*   If the Discovery Search itself encounters an operational error (e.g., an issue with the Qdrant service), a `SolverUnableToGuessError` is raised, wrapping the original exception.

This iterative cycle of guessing, receiving rank feedback, updating context ($\mathcal{C}, V_{target}, \mathcal{V}_{positive\_centroid}$), and strategically querying the vector database allows the solver to progressively narrow the search space towards the secret word.
